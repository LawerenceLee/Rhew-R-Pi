##Overview 
Inspired by the Maker Movement and with the emergence of low cost technologies like Raspberry Pi and Arduino, there is opportunity for research communities to eliminate high cost logging technologies provided by vendors. Lower cost alternatives exist via emerging technologies and with minimal expertise. 

This project walks through setting up devices, creating simple sensor readers, and storage of information.  

Much of the information provided was not created, is merely a helpful aggregation of sample projects and data sheets to aid with re-creating a project or serve as a reference. 

Raspberry Pi code is written as Python scripts.
